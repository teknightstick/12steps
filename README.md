# AA 12 Steps in Pseudo Code
This repository contains an elaborate pseudo-code representation of the 12 Steps of Alcoholics Anonymous (AA). The purpose of this project is to present the AA 12 Steps in a creative and engaging way for those interested in programming.

Please note that this is an artistic interpretation and the pseudo-code is not meant to be executed as actual code.
